      <h2>1977 Atari CX40</h2>
        <p>The Atari 2600 Joystick, formally known as the Atari CX40 Joystick,
           was the first widely-used cross-platform game controller and is the
           first modern iteration of game controllers. It was designed and was
            the official controller for the Atari 2600, which, although wasn't
            the first console, is still one of the most admired 8 bit consoles
            ever to be designed. The controller came from a simpler time, and
            featured a 4-directional Joystick and a singular button to fire with.
            Despite it obvious surface simplicity, this OG controller, which
            imitated its era's arcade cabinets, paved the roads of directional
            standards for future controllers.</p>
