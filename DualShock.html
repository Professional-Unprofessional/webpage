      <h2>1997 PlayStation DualShock Controller</h2>
      <p>Considered by many to be the greatest Video Game controller
      of all time, on the 20th of August 1997, the PlayStation DualShock
      controller, otherwise known as the SCPH-1200 controller, was released.
      Interestingly enough, this controller did not release with a console. <p/>

      <p> This controller formed the design basis for all PlayStation controllers prior,
      as they all feature the D-Pad on the left side, 2 triggers, 2 shoulder buttons,
      plus the Triangle, Circle, Square and X button on the right side, and the analog sticks.
      placed in the middle of the controller. </p>


       <p> This was the successor to the conveniently-named PlayStation Controller, or the SCPH-1010.
       The DualShock built on the SCPH-1010 by adding the signature 2 joysticks on the middle-bottom
       of the controller. The "Shock" portion of the controllers' name derives from its dual-rumble
       motors integrated in the controllers grips. This outshined the Rumble Pak for the N64 by
        including more motors, which were internal, and did not need a battery.  <p/>
