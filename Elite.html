      <h2>2019 Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller</h2>
      <p>To date, this controller remains the single most-advanced controller
        released by Xbox, and still remains one of, if not the best Xbox
        controllers available. Released in 2019 at a retail price of $250AUD,
        this unit of a controller is aimed at those who take gaming a bit more
        seriously. </p>

        <p> Interestingly enough, this controller is amongst the cheaper high-end
        controllers, with controllers coming from a large competitor, Scuf, starting
        at around Â£190. ($350AUD)

        The controller, which costs more to buy than an Xbox One S in 2022,
        is an amalgamation of high quality materials and features. </p>

        <p> Packed to the brim with features, the controller features: easily-interchangeable
        joystick heads of different heights and textures, a swappable D-Pad, rubberised grips,
        adjustable trigger stops on the triggers that allows the user to have actuation on a
        level similar to computer mice, customisable button configurations that can be changed
        via the click of a button on the controller, adjustable analog stick tension that is
        changed with a little tool, a USB-C port that allows easy connection to a computer,
        and 4 detachable paddles on the back of the controller that can be mapped to whatever
        buttons you want. <p/>

        <p> All of this is packaged in a much higher-quality controller shell, that still includes
        all the standard features and buttons of a standard Xbox controller
        (triggers, shoulder buttons, A, B, X, Y buttons, D-Pad, Analog Sticks).

        The controller is powered by an internal rechargeable battery (not removeable)
        that lasts up to 40 hours and is charged via the USB-C port. </p>

        <p> As someone who personally owns and actively gives this controller vigorous use,
        one of the most noticeable differences when you first pick it up is that it quite
        a bit heavier than a standard Xbox Controller, and feels much sturdier. </p>

        <p> It is an absolute dream to use, and if you're more serious about gaming, and can
        look past the heftier price tag, I would highly recommend you pick this up. </p>
