      <h2>Xbox 360 Controller</h2>
      <p>Launched as the Xbox 360's official Controller in 2005 alongside
        the system, the Xbox 360 controller was a fairly big step up from
        the Original Xbox's controller (also known as 'the Duke'). Unlike its
        predecessor, the Xbox 360 Controller came in both wired and wireless
        configurations. The controller came in a variety of colours, including:
        white, black, dark blue, light blue, pink, white S and Black S. The wireless
        variations of the controller were powered by 2 AA batteries, or a rechargeable
        battery pack. </P>

        <p> The controller featured an A, B, X, and Y button, 2 triggers, 2 shoulder buttons,
        a D-Pad, 2 Analog Sticks which were clickable, a start button, and a select button. </p>

        <p> Another big change of the controller came in the form of its form-factor. The Xbox
        360 Controller was quite a significant amount smaller than 'The Duke.' </p>

        <p> It also featured a 2.5mm TRS connector which allowed users to have the option to use
         voice connectivity. </p>
